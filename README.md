# Deep_Q_Learning
Comparison of different Q learning methods

### Training curves

Comparison of how the Dueling Double DQN and Double DQN agents learn Breakout: 
* Results are averaged over 3 random starts. 
* Dueling Double DQN doesn't reach the same performance of Double DQN within the alloted training time but appears to be more stable as it learns.

### Trained agent in action

Trained agents learn to exploit the game by building a tunnel through the bricks to maximize points with minimal effort which is really cool!
